        A hot-air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag,
        called an envelope, which contains heated air. ... The heated air inside
        the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the
        colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot-air balloons
        cannot fly beyond the atmosphere.A hot-air balloon is a lighter-than-air
